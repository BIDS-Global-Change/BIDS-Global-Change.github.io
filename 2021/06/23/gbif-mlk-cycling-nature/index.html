<h1>MLK Shoreline and iNaturalist Observations</h1>
<p>For the last few years I commuted to work most days by bicycle along the <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/martinlking/">Martin Luther King Jr.Â Regional Shoreline Park</a> in Oakland, CA. This will be a series of data science posts exploring personal data collected by my smart watch and publicly available weather, nature and biodiversity data. It is my hope that this will show into the brain of how a data scientist thinks, learns, asks questions, creates models, and visualizes data from right in their back yard through a series of posts. This is an intro post pulling in the data and doing some basic visualizations.</p>

<p>Set a bounding box around the reserve and subset some of the observations from the database.</p>

## 5 Unusual to see a honey bee nectar robbing. This one must have also been one of the oldest honey bee workers I&#39;ve ever seen alive. See the amount of wear on the body hair and wings.

<p>Make a plot of the observations with the Observation Grade as the color. For research projects, we will want to focus on the research graded observations.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mlk_bio_P1  &lt;- ggplot(mlk_bio, aes(x=longitude, y = latitude, color = quality_grade)) +
       geom_point() + labs(color = &quot;Obs Grade&quot;)
mlk_bio_P1</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately this area is near a population center with many biology experts so we have a large fraction of the observations of âresearchâ grade. Letâs plot the different taxa observations on reduced dataframe that only includes the research grade observations.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mlk_bio_research &lt;- subset(mlk_bio, quality_grade == &quot;research&quot;)

mlk_bio_P2  &lt;- ggplot(mlk_bio_research, aes(x=longitude, y = latitude, color = iconic_taxon_name)) +
       geom_point() + labs(color = &quot;Taxon&quot;, title = &quot;MLK Shoreline iNaturalist Observations&quot;)

<p>Take a look with the Open Maps overlay. Definitely over plotted, but will deal with that in the next post.</p>

<h1>Cycle Commuting Data</h1>
<p>I will do another post on how to make this dataset from an exercise watch at another time.</p>
<p>Here is the base dataset we will be working with.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>load(&quot;/Users/rjcmarkelz/Documents/git.repos/BIDS/DATA/MLK-park-commute.RData&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To do some exploratory data analysis, letâs visualize some of the dataframe columns to get a feel for what the data represents. First I like to take a look at the data structure and get a feel for the variables.</p>

<p>Passing data around and filtering instead of creating new dataframes for everything is one of the features of tidyverse that I like the best. It is a different way of thinking that becomes more intuitive over time. Below I take the commute tibble pass it to filter to grab a specific single date. filter() then passes the filtered data to leaflet which plots the latitude and longitude data on an Openmaps popup in the browser.</p>
