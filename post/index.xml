      <description>Bibliography Software + Obsidian Keeping track of scientific papers, code tutorials and snippets, as well as highlighting from digital books has gotten a lot easier of over the past few years. Check out Zotero here. If you are completely new to Zotero work through this quickstart tutorial by Kartcher and Zelle. I have been using Zotero almost exclusively for the past 11 years for PDF management because it has plugins for Word or Google documents to quickly create linked bibliographies for research papers.</description>

      <description>What is it? Obsidian is a way to take notes in markdown and link those notes together. Linking ideas is a powerful way to form new ones and reinforce old ones. Obsidian is fairly flexible, has a large number of extensions, an active community for ideas and troubleshooting, and is kind of an addictive productivity tool.
Why is it interesting? I was originally attracted to this option because I spend a lot of my time making markdown documents as part of daily research activities.</description>

      <description>MLK Shoreline and iNaturalist Observations For the last few years I commuted to work most days by bicycle along the Martin Luther King Jr.Â Regional Shoreline Park in Oakland, CA. This will be a series of data science posts exploring personal data collected by my smart watch and publicly available weather, nature and biodiversity data collected in this park. It is my hope that this will show into the brain of how a data scientist thinks, learns, asks questions, creates models, and visualizes data from right in their back yard through a series of posts.</description>

      <description>Introduction Overall, my research aims to understand how environmental factors, like wild fires, influence biodiversity. One of the most used databases for measuring biodiversity is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF. This is post is a brief introduction of how to use GBIF, using the example of mapping a few conifer species in California.
Load the libraries library(rgbif) library(tidyverse) library(data.table) library(maps) library(leaflet)   Part 1 -Mapping one species Using the R package function occ_data() request data from the GBIF database with the species name, selecting the observations that have a coordinate, and limiting the query to 10000 observations.</description>
