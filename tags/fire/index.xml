      <description>A short post overlaying a few different GIS layers on one another for a project we are working on. The databases used are large so I just show the code here with one final image instead of including them in the website repository. I needed to subset the fire perimeters from the Cal Fire database and overlap them with the UC Reserve perimeters. I also need to in-file some GPS coordinates of post fire sampling sites.</description>

      <title>UC Reserve System Environmental Data - 1</title>

      <description>This post was to fulfill two small goals. I wanted to explore the publicly available UC Reserve Data and learn how to host small datasets within the blogdown blog framework that this website is written in. I also wanted to make sure I could save small output analyses and come back to them at a later date.
There is a good discussion of how hugo can handle internal datasets and how to organize the datasets here.</description>
