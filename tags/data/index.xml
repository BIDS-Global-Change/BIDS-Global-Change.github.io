      <description>A short post overlaying a few different GIS layers on one another for a project we are working on. The databases used are large so I just show the code here with one final image instead of including them in the website repository. I needed to subset the fire perimeters from the Cal Fire database and overlap them with the UC Reserve perimeters. I also need to in-file some GPS coordinates of post fire sampling sites.</description>

      <description>Spring is in full swing in the higher elevations around Mount Shasta and the surrounding ranges. I am always struck by the large patches of Cobra Lilies that grow along nutrient poor seeps in alpine meadows. I nearly always stop to take some photos and take in all the cool colors and shapes when out on training runs or hikes. I have made many observations of these over the past few years, but here is a quick post to pull out observations from GBIF.</description>

      <description>I have been working on identifying and painting various local wildflowers from the book Mount Shasta Wild Flowers A Field Guide featuring the water color paintings of Edward Stuhl. Stuhl was an artist and mountaineer that gradually painted 189 plants over a 50 year career exploring the greater Mount Shasta area. All of his paintings are available to view online at CSU Chico here. I was interested in what sort of publicly available observation data there was for some of the more rare species.</description>

library(rgbif) library(tidyverse) library(maps) I am working on a project using data collected at some of the UC Reserves. I needed to see what observations of insects were available in GBIF. I found this drawing tool for bounding boxes. Make sure to export it as OGC WKT and then you can create a POLYGON to use as your query area.

      <description>I am continueing on my quest of checking off all the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile. I recently found some Jeffrey’s Pine (Pinus jeffreyi) on a trail run while on vacation in the San Bernadino mountains East of Los Angeles. This is in an area where there is also Ponderosa Pine (Pinus Ponderosa). Sometimes the species are confused with one another and can even form hybrids making identification difficult.</description>

      <description>Another species found! I am attempting to ID all the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile while out on runs so I can make a visit to the Miracle Mile and ID all of them in one go.
These sugar pine cones are huge! I have a few in my pinecone collection that are greater than 35 cm! Sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana) are fairly common species and I see them on trail runs often.</description>

      <description>Pinus balfouriana
Western White Pine
Continuing to check off the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile so I can make a visit and try to ID all of them. Last summer I found some Foxtail Pine (Pinus balfouriana) and (Pinus monticola) near Mount Eddy in the Klammath Range (among others).

      <description>I have started checking off all the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile. I recently found some Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia) on a trail run with a friend. This was also my first post to iNaturalist. A good time to take a look at the data.

      <description>Introduction In this post we will look at some spatial data of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and one of thier food sources Blue Winged Olives (Baetis tricaudatus). We will take a look using publically available observation data from the GBIF database. See previous posts here and here for other examples of species occurance data.

      <description>When thinking about how to combine datasets to ask more complex questions it is important to determine where the overlaps in the datasets might be. As an example, The Mount Shasta Avalanche Center keeps records of seasonal weather and avalanche forecast data that I discussed in a previous post. I just made a small movement dataset from some of the ski tours I have done in the Mount Shasta area.</description>

      <description>This post was to fulfill two small goals. I wanted to explore the publicly available UC Reserve Data and learn how to host small datasets within the blogdown blog framework that this website is written in. I also wanted to make sure I could save small output analyses and come back to them at a later date.
There is a good discussion of how hugo can handle internal datasets and how to organize the datasets here.</description>

      <description>A quick post showing how to extract data from a website and make a few plots. I chose the Mount Shasta Avalanche Center data because I monitor this everyday throughout the season to see how the avalanche forecast changes and how the snowpack is developing.
