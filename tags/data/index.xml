      <description>Introduction In this post we will look at some spatial data of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and one of thier food sources Blue Winged Olives (Baetis tricaudatus). We will take a look using publically available observation data from the GBIF database. See previous posts here and here for other examples of species occurance data.
Load the necessary R libraries.
library(rgbif) library(tidyverse) library(data.table) library(maps) library(leaflet) Pull in the species observation data from GBIF.</description>

      <description>When thinking about how to combine datasets to ask more complex questions it is important to determine where the overlaps in the datasets might be. As an example, The Mount Shasta Avalanche Center keeps records of seasonal weather and avalanche forecast data that I discussed in a previous post. I just made a small movement dataset from some of the ski tours I have done in the Mount Shasta area.</description>

      <title>UC Reserve System Environmental Data - 1</title>

      <description>This post was to fulfill two small goals. I wanted to explore the publicly available UC Reserve Data and learn how to host small datasets within the blogdown blog framework that this website is written in. I also wanted to make sure I could save small output analyses and come back to them at a later date.
There is a good discussion of how hugo can handle internal datasets and how to organize the datasets here.</description>

      <description>A quick post showing how to extract data from a website and make a few plots. I chose the Mount Shasta Avalanche Center data because I monitor this everyday throughout the season to see how the avalanche forecast changes and how the snowpack is developing.
R vest There is a great website scraping package that is part of the tidyverse called Rvest. Check out the Documentation.
