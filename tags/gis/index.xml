      <description>Introduction In this post we will look at some spatial data of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and one of thier food sources Blue Winged Olives (Baetis tricaudatus). We will take a look using publically available observation data from the GBIF database. See previous posts here and here for other examples of species occurance data.
Load the necessary R libraries.
library(rgbif) library(tidyverse) library(data.table) library(maps) library(leaflet) Pull in the species observation data from GBIF.</description>

      <description>MLK Shoreline and iNaturalist Observations For the last few years I commuted to work most days by bicycle along the Martin Luther King Jr.Â Regional Shoreline Park in Oakland, CA. This will be a series of data science posts exploring personal data collected by my smart watch and publicly available weather, nature and biodiversity data collected in this park. It is my hope that this will show into the brain of how a data scientist thinks, learns, asks questions, creates models, and visualizes data from right in their back yard through a series of posts.</description>

      <description>Introduction Overall, my research aims to understand how environmental factors, like wild fires, influence biodiversity. One of the most used databases for measuring biodiversity is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF. This is post is a brief introduction of how to use GBIF, using the example of mapping a few conifer species in California.
Load the libraries library(rgbif) library(tidyverse) library(data.table) library(maps) library(leaflet)   Part 1 -Mapping one species Using the R package function occ_data() request data from the GBIF database with the species name, selecting the observations that have a coordinate, and limiting the query to 10000 observations.</description>
