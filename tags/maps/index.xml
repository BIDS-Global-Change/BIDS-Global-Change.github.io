      <title>Mount Shasta Wilderness- Anemone occidentalis population</title>

      <description>I went on a quick overnight to a spring fed creek above 8000 feet on Mount Shasta. I noticed these interesting flowers that I have never seen before. They reminded me of something that Dr. Suess would have illustrated in his various children’s books. After searching the internet with no luck I finally needed rely on some California Botany experts to help with the ID: Anemone occidentalis. The hair-like calyx tissue on top of each ovary are what give this plant it’s unique look once reproductively mature.</description>

      <description>A short post overlaying a few different GIS layers on one another for a project we are working on. The databases used are large so I just show the code here with one final image instead of including them in the website repository. I needed to subset the fire perimeters from the Cal Fire database and overlap them with the UC Reserve perimeters. I also need to in-file some GPS coordinates of post fire sampling sites.</description>

      <description>Spring is in full swing in the higher elevations around Mount Shasta and the surrounding ranges. I am always struck by the large patches of Cobra Lilies that grow along nutrient poor seeps in alpine meadows. I nearly always stop to take some photos and take in all the cool colors and shapes when out on training runs or hikes. I have made many observations of these over the past few years, but here is a quick post to pull out observations from GBIF.</description>

library(rgbif) library(tidyverse) library(maps) I am working on a project using data collected at some of the UC Reserves. I needed to see what observations of insects were available in GBIF. I found this drawing tool for bounding boxes. Make sure to export it as OGC WKT and then you can create a POLYGON to use as your query area.

      <description>I am continueing on my quest of checking off all the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile. I recently found some Jeffrey’s Pine (Pinus jeffreyi) on a trail run while on vacation in the San Bernadino mountains East of Los Angeles. This is in an area where there is also Ponderosa Pine (Pinus Ponderosa). Sometimes the species are confused with one another and can even form hybrids making identification difficult.</description>

      <description>Another species found! I am attempting to ID all the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile while out on runs so I can make a visit to the Miracle Mile and ID all of them in one go.
These sugar pine cones are huge! I have a few in my pinecone collection that are greater than 35 cm! Sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana) are fairly common species and I see them on trail runs often.</description>

      <description>Pinus balfouriana
Western White Pine
Continuing to check off the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile so I can make a visit and try to ID all of them. Last summer I found some Foxtail Pine (Pinus balfouriana) and (Pinus monticola) near Mount Eddy in the Klammath Range (among others).

      <description>I have started checking off all the conifer species that occur in the Miracle Mile. I recently found some Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia) on a trail run with a friend. This was also my first post to iNaturalist. A good time to take a look at the data.

      <description>Introduction In this post we will look at some spatial data of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and one of thier food sources Blue Winged Olives (Baetis tricaudatus). We will take a look using publically available observation data from the GBIF database. See previous posts here and here for other examples of species occurance data.

      <description>MLK Shoreline and iNaturalist Observations For the last few years I commuted to work most days by bicycle along the Martin Luther King Jr. Regional Shoreline Park in Oakland, CA. This will be a series of data science posts exploring personal data collected by my smart watch and publicly available weather, nature and biodiversity data collected in this park. It is my hope that this will show into the brain of how a data scientist thinks, learns, asks questions, creates models, and visualizes data from right in their back yard through a series of posts.</description>

      <description>Introduction Overall, my research aims to understand how environmental factors, like wild fires, influence biodiversity. One of the most used databases for measuring biodiversity is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF. This is post is a brief introduction of how to use GBIF, using the example of mapping a few conifer species in California.
