      <description>What is it? Obsidian is a way to take notes in markdown and link those notes together. Linking ideas is a powerful way to form new ones and reinforce old ones. Obsidian is fairly flexible, has a large number of extensions, an active community for ideas and troubleshooting, and is kind of an addictive productivity tool.
Why is it interesting? I was originally attracted to this option because I spend a lot of my time making markdown documents as part of daily research activities.</description>
