      <description>I have been working on identifying and painting various local wildflowers from the book Mount Shasta Wild Flowers A Field Guide featuring the water color paintings of Edward Stuhl. Stuhl was an artist and mountaineer that gradually painted 189 plants over a 50 year career exploring the greater Mount Shasta area. All of his paintings are available to view online at CSU Chico here. I was interested in what sort of publicly available observation data there was for some of the more rare species.</description>
