<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this post we will look at some spatial data of Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and one of thier food sources Blue Winged Olives (<em>Baetis tricaudatus</em>). We will take a look using publically available observation data from the GBIF database. See previous posts <a href="/2021/06/17/gbif-miracle-mile-species/">here</a> and <a href="/2021/06/23/inaturalist-mlk-nature/">here</a> for other examples of species occurance data.</p>
<p>Load the necessary R libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rgbif)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(maps)
library(leaflet)</code></pre>
<p>Pull in the species observation data from GBIF.</p>

<p>Subset these datasets for only a few pieces of data.</p>
